Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the\r\n","complexity of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values, which\r\n","makes the distribution of weight values more ”regular”. This is called ”weight\r\n","regularization”, and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a\r\n","cost associated with having large weights. This cost comes in two flavors:\r\n","\r\n","* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the absolute value of the weights coefficients (i.e. to what is called the “L1 norm” of\r\n","the weights).\r\n","* L2 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the square of\r\n","the value of the weights coefficients (i.e. to what is called the “L2 norm” of\r\n","the weights). L2 regularization is also called weight decay in the context of\r\n","neural networks. Don’t let the different name confuse you: weight decay\r\n","is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\r\n","\r\n","In Keras, weight regularization is added by passing weight regularizer instances\r\n","to layers as keyword arguments: for instance, kernel regularizer=\r\n","regularizers.l1(0.001) where l2(0.001) means that every coefficient in the\r\n","weight matrix of the layer will add 0.001 * weight coefficient value to the total\r\n","loss of the network. Note that because this penalty is only added at training\r\n","time, the loss for this network will be much higher at training than at test time"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hwdKdkN_SDvp"},"source":[" Modify the original network as l2 model by adding an L2 weight\r\n","regularization to the model1\r\n",".
